A decision tree is a visual tool that helps analyze decisions and their potential outcomes in a structured and systematic manner. Here's a template to help you create a decision tree:

## 1. Define the Decision:

Clearly state the decision you need to make or the problem you need to solve. Be specific and concise.
## 2. Identify the Alternatives:

List the possible alternatives or courses of action available to you. These are the different options you can choose from in making your decision.
## 3. Determine the Criteria:

Identify the criteria or factors that are important in evaluating the alternatives. These criteria should be relevant to the decision and reflect your objectives or desired outcomes.
## 4. Assign Weights to Criteria:

Assign weights to each criterion to indicate their relative importance or priority. These weights reflect the significance of each criterion in the decision-making process.
## 5. Develop the Decision Tree:

Start with a square or rectangular box at the top of the page representing the initial decision or problem.
Draw lines stemming from the box to represent the different alternative choices.
At the end of each line representing an alternative, draw smaller lines representing the possible outcomes or consequences of that alternative.
Connect the outcomes to the alternative choices using lines.
## 6. Evaluate Outcomes:

For each possible outcome, evaluate its desirability or how well it satisfies the identified criteria. Assign a score or rating to each outcome for each criterion.
## 7. Calculate the Expected Value:

Multiply the score or rating of each outcome by the weight of the corresponding criterion.
Sum up the weighted scores for each alternative to calculate the expected value of that alternative.
## 8. Make the Decision:

Based on the calculated expected values, identify the alternative with the highest expected value. This alternative represents the best choice or decision based on the criteria and their respective weights.
## 9. Consider Uncertainty:

If there is uncertainty or probability associated with the outcomes, you can assign probabilities to the different outcomes and calculate expected values using probabilities instead of scores.
## 10. Review and Refine:

Periodically review and refine the decision tree as new information becomes available or as circumstances change. Update the criteria, weights, and alternatives as needed.

Decision Trees can be as simple or complex as necessary to capture the nuances of your decision-making process. Customize the template to fit your specific decision context and consider seeking input from relevant stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
