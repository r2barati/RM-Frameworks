Based on the provided requirements and priorities for 2016 from IIROC (Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada), here are the compliance measures that IIROC-regulated firms (Dealer Members) should focus on:

## 1. Cybersecurity:
- Implement best-practice cybersecurity recommendations published in IIROC Notice 15-0294 (December 21, 2015).
- Develop a cyber-incident management planning guide with the assistance of an independent third-party cybersecurity firm.
- Host webinars to help Dealer Members understand cybersecurity guides and stay informed about emerging cybersecurity issues, challenges, and best practices.
- Conduct a more extensive self-assessment survey among regulated firms to measure the adequacy of their cybersecurity infrastructure.
- Inform IIROC-regulated firms about how well their cybersecurity practices compare to those of their peers.
- Collaborate with and advise Dealer Members to assess their readiness and implement cybersecurity systems and procedures for the protection of client data against cybersecurity threats.
- Consider working with and/or relying on other regulators (e.g., OSFI and/or FINRA) where Dealer Members are already subject to similar cybersecurity oversight to avoid duplication.

## 2. Outsourcing Arrangements:
- Remind firms that outsourcing regulated activities does not diminish their responsibility for full compliance with applicable IIROC rules and securities laws.
- Stress the importance of supervising service provider performance.

## 3. Custodial Arrangements:
- Ensure that all securities held beyond the physical possession of the Dealer Member are held at an "acceptable securities location" as defined in IIROC rules and supported by written custody agreements with specified provisions.
- Review and update policies and procedures to comply with IIROC minimum standards for internal control over the safeguarding of customer-held securities, including acceptable securities locations and required custody agreement provisions.

## 4. Debt Concentration Test and Capital Charge:
- Prepare for the proposed new Rules Notice 14-0298, which may impact client free credit cash usage limits, segregation requirements, and securities concentration tests.
- Ensure procedures and systems are in place to compile and report concentration of related debt issuer's securities with a margin rate of less than 10%.

## 5. T+2 Settlement:
- Prepare for the transition from T+3 to T+2 settlement in the third quarter of 2017, following the coordination efforts of the Canadian Capital Markets Association (CCMA).
- Monitor settlement and clearing system readiness, and observe and assess industry test results in preparation for the T+2 transition.

- Review and enhance policies, procedures, and supervision of best execution to align with proposed amendments to best execution rules.
- Assess trading practices surrounding the routing of orders for Canadian listed securities to foreign jurisdictions for execution.

## 9. Trading Compliance - Electronic Trading:
- Ensure that risk control thresholds for direct market access are set and regularly reviewed to protect against disruptions in orderly trading and financial loss due to erroneous order entry.

## 10. Trading Compliance - Third Party Access:
