# Risk Event Database
Creating a risk event database involves systematically collecting and organizing information about past risk events or incidents that have occurred within an organization. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a risk event database:

## 1. Determine the Scope: 
Define the scope of the risk event database, including the types of risk events you want to capture (e.g., operational, financial, cybersecurity) and the timeframe of data collection (e.g., past 5 years).

## 2. Identify Data Fields: 
Determine the data fields or attributes you want to capture for each risk event. Common fields include:
   - Event ID: A unique identifier for each risk event.
   - Date and Time: The date and time when the risk event occurred.
   - Event Description: A detailed description of the risk event, including its causes, consequences, and any relevant details.
   - Risk Category: Categorize the risk event into specific risk categories (e.g., operational, financial, legal).
   - Impact: Assess the impact of the risk event in terms of financial, operational, reputational, or other relevant impacts.
   - Likelihood: Assess the likelihood or probability of the risk event occurring.
   - Risk Owner: Identify the person or department responsible for managing or mitigating the risk event.
   - Mitigation Measures: Document any mitigation measures or actions taken to address the risk event.
   - Lessons Learned: Identify any key lessons learned or recommendations for preventing similar risk events in the future.

## 3. Data Collection: 
Collect historical data on past risk events. This may involve reviewing incident reports, historical records, incident response logs, or conducting interviews with relevant stakeholders who were involved in managing or responding to the risk events.

## 4. Create a Database Structure: 
Use a database management system (DBMS) or spreadsheet software to create a structured database to store the risk event data. Create columns for each data field identified in step 2.

## 5. Data Entry: 
Enter the historical risk event data into the database, ensuring that each data field is populated accurately and consistently.

## 6. Data Analysis: 
Once the risk event data is populated in the database, you can perform data analysis and generate insights. This may involve analyzing trends, identifying common root causes, evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and identifying areas for improvement.

## 7. Ongoing Data Collection: 
Implement a process to capture and document new risk events as they occur. This could include incident reporting mechanisms, regular risk event reviews, or automated data feeds from relevant systems.

## 8. Regular Review and Update: 
Regularly review and update the risk event database to ensure that it remains comprehensive and up to date.
