Here's how to use the template:

1. Divide the template into a grid based on the severity and likelihood of risks, with high, medium, and low categories for each.

2. Assess each risk associated with the process and determine its impact and likelihood.

3. Place the risks in the respective cells of the grid based on their impact and likelihood ratings.

4. Provide a brief description of each risk in the corresponding cell, including relevant details or specific examples.

5. Customize the template by adding additional columns or rows as needed, based on the complexity of the process or the number of risks involved.

The process risk map provides a visual representation of risks based on their impact and likelihood. It helps identify high-risk areas within the process and prioritize risk mitigation efforts accordingly. Customize the template further based on your specific process and risk assessment requirements.
