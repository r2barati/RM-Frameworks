Inherent risk, also known as inherent risk exposure, is a concept used in risk assessment and refers to the level of risk associated with a specific activity, process, or situation without considering any controls or mitigating measures in place. It represents the risk that exists inherently, or inherently within a particular context, before any risk management efforts are implemented.

Here are a few key points to understand about inherent risk:

## 1. Definition: 
Inherent risk is the risk level associated with an activity or situation in its natural state, without any risk mitigation measures. It reflects the inherent characteristics, vulnerabilities, and uncertainties that are inherent to the activity itself.

## 2. Factors Influencing Inherent Risk: 
Inherent risk can be influenced by various factors, including the complexity of the process, the nature of the activity or transaction, industry-specific risks, external environment factors, regulatory requirements, and the potential impact on objectives.

## 3. Impact on Risk Assessment: 
Inherent risk is one of the components used to assess overall risk. When conducting a risk assessment, inherent risk is evaluated along with other factors, such as the effectiveness of existing controls, to determine the residual risk, which is the risk level after considering the mitigating measures.

## 4. Relationship with Control Environment: 
Inherent risk is distinct from the control environment or the risk management measures in place. While inherent risk represents the natural risk level, the control environment encompasses the policies, procedures, controls, and mitigation strategies implemented to reduce or manage the identified risks.

## 5. Risk Management Implications: 
Assessing inherent risk is crucial for effective risk management. It helps organizations identify and understand the underlying risks that need to be addressed. By recognizing the inherent risk, organizations can design and implement appropriate risk management strategies, controls, and processes to mitigate the identified risks to an acceptable level.

## 6. Subjectivity and Evaluation: 
Assessing inherent risk requires subjective judgment and evaluation based on expertise, experience, and available information. Different stakeholders or experts may have varying opinions on the level of inherent risk, and it can be influenced by the organization's risk appetite, industry norms, and regulatory requirements.

## 7. Dynamic Nature: 
Inherent risk is not static and can change over time due to various factors, such as changes in the business environment, technology advancements, or regulatory changes. It is important for organizations to regularly reassess inherent risks to ensure that risk management strategies remain relevant and effective.
