# Output Risk Scoreboard

An example of an output risk scoreboard to visualize and communicate the risks identified during a risk assessment:

## Risk Scoreboard

| Risk Category | Risk Description        | Likelihood | Impact | Severity |
| ------------- | -----------------------| -----------| -------| ---------|
| Category 1    | Risk 1 description     | High       | Medium | High     |
|               | Risk 2 description     | Low        | High   | Medium   |
| Category 2    | Risk 3 description     | Medium     | Low    | Low      |
|               | Risk 4 description     | High       | High   | High     |

In this example, the scoreboard includes the following columns:

## 1. Risk Category: 
Categorize risks based on their nature or the area of the organization they affect. This helps in organizing and grouping risks for better clarity.

## 2. Risk Description: 
Provide a concise description of each identified risk.

## 3. Likelihood: 
Assess the likelihood or probability of the risk occurring. It can be categorized as high, medium, or low based on the assessment.

## 4. Impact: 
Evaluate the potential impact or consequence if the risk event occurs. Assess the impact as high, medium, or low based on the assessment.

## 5. Severity: 
Calculate the risk severity by combining the likelihood and impact ratings. It helps prioritize risks based on their overall risk level, with high, medium, or low severity.

The risk scoreboard provides a snapshot of the identified risks, their likelihood, impact, and severity. It helps stakeholders quickly understand the key risks and their relative significance. You can customize the scoreboard based on your specific risk assessment criteria and add or remove columns as needed.

## Enhanced Risk Scoreboard

| Risk Category | Risk Description        | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Current Status |
| ------------- | -----------------------| -----------| -------| ---------| -----------| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Category 1    | Risk 1 description     | High       | Medium | High     | John Doe   | Implement controls  | In progress    |
|               | Risk 2 description     | Low        | High   | Medium   | Jane Smith | Develop contingency | Not started    |
| Category 2    | Risk 3 description     | Medium     | Low    | Low      | Mark Lee   | Enhance monitoring  | Completed      |
|               | Risk 4 description     | High       | High   | High     | Sarah Wong | Transfer risk       | In progress    |

In this enhanced risk scoreboard, the additional columns are as follows:

## 6. Risk Owner: 
Assign a specific individual or department responsible for managing each identified risk. This ensures accountability and clear ownership of risk mitigation efforts.

## 7. Mitigation Strategy: 
Outline the specific strategies or actions that will be implemented to mitigate each identified risk. This column describes the approach or measures taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.

## 8. Current Status: 
Provide an update on the current status of risk mitigation efforts for each identified risk. This column helps track the progress of mitigation activities and provides an overview of the overall risk management progress.

| Risk ID | Risk Category | Risk Description        | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Mitigation Progress | Residual Likelihood | Residual Impact | Residual Severity |
| ------- | ------------- | -----------------------| -----------| -------| ---------| -----------| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| R001    | Category 1    | Risk 1 description     | High       | Medium | High     | John Doe   | Implement controls  | In progress         | Medium              | Low              | Medium            |
| R002    | Category 1    | Risk 2 description     | Low        | High   | Medium   | Jane Smith | Develop contingency | Not started         | Low                 | High             | High              |
| R003    | Category 2    | Risk 3 description     | Medium     | Low    | Low      | Mark Lee   | Enhance monitoring  | Completed           | Low                 | Low              | Low               |
| R004    | Category 2    | Risk 4 description     | High       | High   | High     | Sarah Wong | Transfer risk       | In progress         | Low                 | Medium           | Medium            |

In this enhanced risk scoreboard, the additional columns are as follows:

## 9. Mitigation Progress: 
Provide an update on the progress of risk mitigation efforts for each identified risk. This column allows tracking and monitoring the implementation of the mitigation strategies and actions.

## 10. Residual Likelihood: 
Assess the likelihood of the risk after implementing the mitigation measures. This column reflects the estimated likelihood of the risk event occurring despite the mitigation efforts.

## 11. Residual Impact: 
Evaluate the impact of the risk after implementing the mitigation measures. This column indicates the potential consequence of the risk event, considering the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies.

## 12. Residual Severity: 
Calculate the residual risk severity by combining the residual likelihood and impact ratings. This column helps assess the overall risk level after considering the mitigation efforts.

Including these additional columns provides a more comprehensive view of the identified risks, their mitigation progress, and the residual risk levels. It enables stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies and prioritize risk management efforts. Customize the scoreboard further based on your organization's specific risk assessment and reporting requirements.
