# Frequency-Severity Risk Mapping

|           | High Severity   | Medium Severity | Low Severity   |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| High      | High Risk       | Medium Risk     | Low Risk       |
| Moderate  | High Risk       | Medium Risk     | Low Risk       |
| Low       | Medium Risk     | Low Risk        | Negligible Risk|

In this template, risks are categorized based on their frequency (likelihood) and severity, resulting in different risk levels. The cells in the table represent the risk assessment based on the combination of frequency and severity ratings:

### High Severity: 
Risks with a high potential impact or consequence if they occur.
### Medium Severity: 
Risks with a moderate potential impact or consequence if they occur.
### Low Severity: 
Risks with a low potential impact or consequence if they occur.

### High Frequency: 
Risks that are likely to occur frequently or have a high likelihood of occurrence.
### Moderate Frequency: 
Risks that have a moderate likelihood of occurrence.
### Low Frequency: 
Risks that have a low likelihood of occurrence.

### High Risk: 
Risks that pose a significant threat and require immediate attention and mitigation.
### Medium Risk: 
Risks that require attention and appropriate mitigation measures.
### Low Risk: 
Risks that are manageable and may not require immediate action but should be monitored.
### Negligible Risk: 
Risks that have minimal impact and can be considered within acceptable limits.

To use the template, evaluate each identified risk and assign appropriate frequency and severity ratings based on the risk assessment. Then, plot the risk on the template by matching its frequency and severity ratings to determine the corresponding risk level. This helps in prioritizing risks and allocating resources accordingly for risk mitigation efforts.

In this model, risks are categorized based on their severity (impact) and frequency (likelihood) ratings. The cells in the table represent the risk assessment based on the combination of severity and frequency:

## Severity:
  - High Impact: Risks with a high potential impact or consequence if they occur.
  - Medium Impact: Risks with a moderate potential impact or consequence if they occur.
  - Low Impact: Risks with a low potential impact or consequence if they occur.

## Frequency:
  - High Frequency: Risks that are likely to occur frequently or have a high likelihood of occurrence.
  - Medium Frequency: Risks that have a moderate likelihood of occurrence.
  - Low Frequency: Risks that have a low likelihood of occurrence.

## Risk Categories:
  - Critical Risks: Risks that pose a severe threat and require immediate attention and mitigation.
  - Significant Risks: Risks that require attention and appropriate mitigation measures.
  - Important Risks: Risks that should be monitored and addressed to prevent potential issues.
  - High Potential Risks: Risks that have a high potential impact or consequence, but with high uncertainty due to low frequency.
  - Moderate Potential Risks: Risks that have a moderate potential impact or consequence, but with moderate uncertainty due to medium frequency.
  - Low Potential Risks: Risks that have a low potential impact or consequence, but with low uncertainty due to high frequency.
  - Negligible Risks: Risks with minimal impact and can be considered within acceptable limits.

To use the model, evaluate each identified risk and assign appropriate severity and frequency ratings based on the risk assessment. Then, plot the risk on the model by matching its severity and frequency ratings to determine the corresponding risk category. This provides a multidimensional view of the risks, considering both their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.

Remember to adapt the model to suit your specific risk assessment criteria, severity and frequency rating scales, and risk categories. Regularly review and update the risk mapping to reflect changes in the risk landscape and ensure the effectiveness of risk management efforts.
