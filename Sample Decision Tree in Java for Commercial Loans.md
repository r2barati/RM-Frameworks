To build a decision tree for risk assessment in Java, we can use the Weka library, which provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including decision tree models. Here's how you can implement the same decision tree example in Java using Weka:

First, make sure you have the Weka library added to your Java project. You can download the Weka library from the official website: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

Create a Java class for the risk assessment with the following code:

``` java
import weka.core.Instances;
import weka.core.converters.ConverterUtils.DataSource;
import weka.classifiers.trees.J48;
import weka.classifiers.Evaluation;

public class RiskAssessmentDecisionTree {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Load the dataset
            DataSource source = new DataSource("path/to/cre_loans_data.arff");
            Instances dataset = source.getDataSet();

            // Assuming the last attribute is the target variable (good_loan)
            dataset.setClassIndex(dataset.numAttributes() - 1);

            // Build the decision tree model (J48)
            J48 decisionTree = new J48();
            decisionTree.buildClassifier(dataset);

            // Evaluate the model using cross-validation
            Evaluation evaluation = new Evaluation(dataset);
            evaluation.crossValidateModel(decisionTree, dataset, 10, new java.util.Random(1));

            // Print the evaluation results
            System.out.println("Decision Tree Evaluation Results:");
            System.out.println(evaluation.toSummaryString());

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) is a widely used format to represent datasets in Weka.

The code above uses the J48 algorithm, which is an implementation of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, to build the decision tree model and evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation. This ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on different subsets of the data to avoid overfitting.

For a real-world scenario, you should use actual data from a commercial real estate loan portfolio, and it may require additional preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training the decision tree model.
