Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a structured approach used to identify potential failures, assess their impact, and prioritize actions to mitigate or prevent them. Here's a template to help you create an FMEA:

## 1. Define the Scope:
   - Clearly define the scope of the FMEA, specifying the system, process, or product that will be analyzed.

## 2. Assemble the FMEA Team:
   - Form a cross-functional team with relevant expertise and knowledge of the system or process being analyzed. Include representatives from different departments or disciplines.

## 3. Identify Functions and Failure Modes:
   - Identify the primary functions or processes performed by the system or process.
   - For each function, list the potential failure modes or ways in which the function could fail to perform as intended.

## 4. Assign Severity Ratings:
   - Evaluate the potential severity of each failure mode on a scale (e.g., 1-10) based on the impact it would have on the system, process, or end-user. Consider factors such as safety, regulatory compliance, customer satisfaction, and financial impact.

## 5. Identify Causes and Assign Occurrence Ratings:
   - Identify the potential causes or factors that could lead to each failure mode.
   - Assess the likelihood or occurrence of each cause leading to the corresponding failure mode, using a rating scale (e.g., 1-10) based on historical data, expert judgment, or statistical analysis.

## 6. Detectability Assessment:
   - Evaluate the likelihood of detecting each failure mode before it reaches the end-user or causes significant harm. Assign a rating (e.g., 1-10) based on the effectiveness of current detection mechanisms, such as inspections, tests, or monitoring.

## 7. Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN):
   - Calculate the Risk Priority Number by multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detectability ratings for each failure mode. RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detectability.

## 8. Prioritize Actions:
   - Prioritize the failure modes based on their RPN values. Focus on high RPN values, indicating higher risks.
   - Identify and prioritize actions or improvements to mitigate or eliminate the identified failure modes. Assign responsibility and due dates for each action item.

## 9. Implement Actions and Follow Up:
   - Implement the recommended actions to reduce the occurrence, severity, or detectability of failure modes.
   - Establish a mechanism to track and monitor the progress of action items. Conduct regular follow-ups to ensure actions are completed and effective.

## 10. Review and Update: 
- Periodically review and update the FMEA to incorporate new insights, changes in the system or process, or lessons learned from incidents or near-misses.

The FMEA template should be tailored to fit your specific system, process, or product. Adapt and customize the template to suit your organization's needs and ensure active participation from relevant stakeholders throughout the FMEA process.
